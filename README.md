# TLF Orientation talk notes

```
There are tons of tons of contents to learn tech online. 
The problem is people don't know what to pick and where to go. 
Thats where you people come in !
```

## The power of Training 

- My experience as a tech facilitator - those surprise thank you messages on a bad day and more
- This is a chain reaction - You train people, those people train a 1000 people !

## Our work

- There is no right learning path - but we can create good ones !
- No more jargaons 
- create take aways - tasks, boilerplate codes, projects


## Open source by design

Its true that people are bit scared to use tools like terminal and github

- Use git and github to create and present content
- Ask participants to upload tasks/projects to github for evaluation

This way when there is a necessity for using these tools people tend to give it a try and that will fix their fear to try out !

## Empathy is key, inclusivity is life

- Our contents are not only for him
- Our contents are not only for people comfortable and fluent in English
